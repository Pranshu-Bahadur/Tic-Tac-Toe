# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Introduction:

A basic version of the popular game "Tic Tac Toe" also known as Knots & Crosses.
The purpose of this project from me was to learn and apply the Minimax algorithm with Alpha Beta Pruning.

## Minimax and Alpha Beta Pruning:

### Pseudocode for Minimax:

## How to run the Game?

### For Windows:
1. Download the repository and unzip it.
2. Unzip the "Tic-Tac-Toe Game".zip file
